            <h3>An ultra sturdy solid-box-design X-Ray Merchant board intended for use with modern expensive DR digital
                panels
                and or plates.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Provides for a fixed 45 degree angle from the end of typical radiographic imaging tables.
                Includes leg straps to hold both legs closely together for dual comparison of both legs in a single
                shot.
                Available in two models; the 1104-C3, which does not come with side arms (for those institutions which
                prefer using
                an external and separate panel holder for more flexibility on detector placement during merchant exams)
                and the 1104-C3a model
                which DOES come with dual removable side arms. Arms are constructed of solid aluminum C-Channels with
                adjustable depth stops
                that securely hold the panel just above the patient’s shins. Both arms on the 1104-C3a have dual
                positions which allow the
                plate to be positioned 8" or 12" inches down the 45° slope from the tables surface.
            </p>

            <h3>Features of both models:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>White laminate covering on all surfaces (custom colors/patterns available) which is easy to sanitize
                    after each use.</li>
                <li>Four heavy duty, very quiet swivel casters with easy to actuate toe-locks for locking both the
                    swivel and roll motions.</li>
                <li>Patient leg strap to hold legs close together with no patient strain.</li>
                <li>Hand slots on both side for carrying and/or moving unit.</li>
                <li>Aluminum reinforcements on back corners to prevent damage from bumping into your table during setup.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Additional features provided with the 1104-C3a model:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dual removable side-arms provide for secure plate retention and positioning during merchant exams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Both arms remove quickly to allow your patient to swing their legs into position from either side of
                    the apparatus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Two longitudinal position slots for both side arms allow for two different distance settings of the
                    plate slot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adjustable slide-stop pins on the side arms prevent the plate from resting on the patients shins.

            <h2>PNWX Light Duty Merchant Board for Film Cassettes.</h2>
            <p>A top quality Merchant board constructed of solid oak (no plywood!) with a formica laminate top covering.
                The formica covering resists scratches and makes cleanup easy! This unit features a heavy base design
                which makes it very stable during merchant exams. The vertical section has two wing nuts which allow the
                unit to be adjusted for table tops ranging from 29½" up to 36". The auto-locking hinge allows the tilt
                section to be adjusted from 10 to about 80 degrees and is easily released with one finger once the
                weight is removed. The tilting section is 12 3/8" wide and 18" long. The arms hold the cassette, folding
                in which allows the patient to easily swing his/her leg up and on top of the board. The entire unit,
                once collapsed, can easily be stored in a closet in the upright position with minimal space concerns.
                Compatible with CR.</p>
            <p>Do you need a foam triangle, a cassette, or a grid to use with this?</p>
            <p>Unit is protected by a 90 day limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship.
                Product is built at time of order and will ship approx 6-8 weeks after receipt of order.
                Not suitable for use with DR panels but works fine for CR and film cassettes.</p>
