                <p>
                    <span> An ultra sturdy solid-box-design X-Ray Merchant board intended for use with modern expensive
                        DR digital panels and or plates.</span>

                    Provides for a fixed 45 degree angle from the end of typical radiographic imaging tables.
                    Includes leg straps to hold both legs closely together for dual comparison of both legs in a single
                    shot. Available in two models; the 1104-C3, which does not come with side arms (for those
                    institutions
                    which prefer using an external and separate panel holder for more flexibility on detector placement
                    during merchant
                    exams) and the 1104-C3a model which DOES come with dual removable side arms. Arms are constructed of
                    solid aluminum
                    C-Channels with adjustable depth stops that securely hold the panel just above the patient’s shins.
                    Both arms on
                    the 1104-C3a have dual positions which allow the plate to be positioned 8" or 12" inches down the
                    45° slope
                    from the tables surface.

                    <li>Four heavy duty, very quiet swivel casters with easy to actuate toe-locks for locking both the
                        swivel and roll motions.</li>

                        Both arms remove quickly to allow your patient to swing their legs into position from either

                        Two longitudinal position slots for both side arms allow for two different distance settings of

            <h2 class="cassettes__title">PNWX Light Duty Merchant Board for Film Cassettes.</h2>
            <p class="cassettes__txt">A top quality Merchant board constructed of <span>solid oak</span> (no plywood!) <span>with a formica
                laminate</span> top covering.
                The formica covering resists scratches and makes cleanup easy! This unit features a heavy base design
                which makes it very stable during merchant exams. The vertical section has two wing nuts which allow the
                unit to be adjusted for table tops ranging from 29½" up to 36". The auto-locking hinge allows the tilt
                section to be adjusted from 10 to about 80 degrees and is easily released with one finger once the
                weight is removed. The tilting section is 12 3/8" wide and 18" long. The arms hold the cassette, folding
                in which allows the patient to easily swing his/her leg up and on top of the board. The entire unit,
                once collapsed, can easily be stored in a closet in the upright position with minimal space concerns.
                <span>Compatible with CR.</span> <br><br>
                Do you need a <a href="#">foam triangle</a>, a <a href="#">cassette</a>, or a <a href="#">grid</a> to use with this?<br><br>
                Unit is protected by a 90 day limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship.
                Product is built at time of order and will ship approx 6-8 weeks after receipt of order.
                Not suitable for use with DR panels but works fine for CR and film cassettes.
