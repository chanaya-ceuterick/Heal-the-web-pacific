                    Sold only with glass- see above. Lead lined telescopic steel frames are fabricated with 16 gauge
                    Jetcoat, Hot Dipped Galvanized Steel, electro-galvanized. Paint Lock or
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvannealed">Galvannealed</a> with 1/16"
                    (1.58mm) or 5/64"(2.0mm) standard lead lining (Higher shielding ratings available upon request).
                    These windows
                    are manufactured for ease of installation in new rough opening "hole in wall" after lead backed
                    wallboard is installed or in existing retrofit cut-out applications.
                    Promptly available in over 40 standard sizes "ready to ship" in just 3 to 4 days, and custom sizes
                    available in only 10 working days. Telescopic frames are also available with many other custom
                    designs, profiles or shielding options to choose from.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="subtitle-underlined--bold">THE FRAME</span> <br>
                    The Lined Telescopic X-Ray Control View Window frame is a modular 2-piece frame that adjusts to wall
                    thicknesses ranging from a minimum
                    of 4 1/4" to a maximum of 8". (Custom sizing available, call for options and pricing.) The standard
                    frame profile will fit into a rough
                    opening "hole in wall" of 1" larger than the ordered size. For example, a control window frame
                    ordered
                    as a 24" x 24" will fit into a rough
                    opening of 25" x 25" hole in the wall. Frame is primed/galvanized and ready to paint.
