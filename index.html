            <p>X-Ray Glass Glazing Tape is 3/8" x 3/8" (0.375" x 0.375") and available in 25' 0" (300") length rolls.
                This product is adhesive backed for ease of installation in hollow metal frames and removable stops.

                Unlike other glazing tapes, X-Ray Glass Glazing Tape is non-reactive and will not break down when
                exposed to radiation.
                It provides even cushioned support around the perimeter of the x-ray glass, metal frame, and removable
                stop assembly.
                This product is highly recommended for all x-ray glass installations when not purchasing our frame.

            <img src="assets/image-05.jpg" alt="leaded-glass-img">
            <p>
                Sold only with glass- see above. Lead lined telescopic steel frames are fabricated with 16 gauge
                Jetcoat,
                Hot Dipped Galvanized Steel, electro-galvanized. Paint Lock or Galvannealed with 1/16" (1.58mm) or
                5/64"(2.0mm)
                standard lead lining (Higher shielding ratings available upon request). These windows are manufactured
                for ease of
                installation in new rough opening "hole in wall" after lead backed wallboard is installed or in existing
                retrofit cut-out applications.
                Promptly available in over 40 standard sizes "ready to ship" in just 3 to 4 days, and custom sizes
                available in only 10 working days.
                Telescopic frames are also available with many other custom designs, profiles or shielding options to
                choose from.
            </p>
            <h3>THE FRAME</h3>
            <p>The Lined Telescopic X-Ray Control View Window frame is a modular 2-piece frame that adjusts to wall
                thicknesses ranging from a minimum
                of 4 1/4" to a maximum of 8". (Custom sizing available, call for options and pricing.) The standard
                frame profile will fit into a rough
                opening "hole in wall" of 1" larger than the ordered size. For example, a control window frame ordered
                as a 24" x 24" will fit into a rough
                opening of 25" x 25" hole in the wall. Frame is primed/galvanized and ready to paint.
            </p>
            <h3>Available Special Options...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>BOTTOM VOICE PASSAGE BAFFLE: Allows for better voice transmission and communication through the
                    bottom sill of the window. This allows for clearer communication between the x-ray technician and
                    patient during medical imaging procedures.</li>
                <li>45 DEGREE "SPLAYED" FACES: Allows wider angle range of view into image room, particularly beneficial
                    on smaller frame sizes or frames occurring in very thick walls.</li>
                <li>VERTICAL CENTER MULLION(S): Allows for larger width with 2 or more panes of X-Ray Glass while also
                    providing additional overall frame strength and support.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="assets/image-03.jpg" alt="leaded-glass-img">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    VERTICAL "T" JOINTS: Allows larger width frames with a very narrow vertical shielded joint of
                    approximately 1/2" between X-Ray Glass panes.
                    This provides less vision obstruction in view area, however, it does not provide any additional
                    frame strength.
                </li>
                <li>
                    EXTRA THICK WALL FRAME THROATS: Allows frame to adjust beyond the standard 7-1/2" wide wall, for
                    extra thick stud or concrete walls available up to 24" wide or as per customers project conditions
                    and requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HEAVY LEAD-LINING: Heavier lead-lining beyond the standard 1/16" (1.6mm).
                    Available in a variety of thicknesses for higher energy shielding applications. Available from 3/32"
                    (2.4mm) and up to 1"
